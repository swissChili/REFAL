SETUP

	If you don't get console output from REFAL run:
	export QT_LOGGING_RULES="*.debug=true"


DEPENDENCIES

	Install libreadline-dev and libqt5core5a


OPTIMIZATION POSSIBILITIES:

	When parsing e.* variables check the min length of the remaining tokens. If
	we have `e.1 s.2' for instance, we can tell right away how long `e.1' wil
	have to be.


EVALUATION

	There are several parts to evaluation:

	- Pattern matching and delegation (which sentence of a function do we choose to evaluate)
	- Expression evaluation (how do we expand an AstNode stream into a Token stream)
